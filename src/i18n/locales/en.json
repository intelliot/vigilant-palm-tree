        "a": "While there is no set range, we intend to award between $10,000 and $200,000 per project. Awards of $150,000 and greater are typically for developers who have already successfully completed a project. In general, the larger the award, the more scrutiny the application will receive and the more questions the committee will have regarding how the money will be used. All projects must include a statement of work that helps the committee understand how the amount of funding requested was determined."

The minimum is at least 4-8 hours of work (e.g. a minimum viable product or proof of concept created over a weekend). We will not fund projects that do not have at least some substantial open-source component."

        "q": "How should I determine what size of an award to apply for?",

Amounts applied for should be sized such that any tax or other liability that will be incurred is accounted for. We reserve the right to use different payment mechanisms or tax characterizations for different awards in the program based on a number of factors specific to each award."
